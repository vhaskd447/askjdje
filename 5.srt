00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,102
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON</i>
<i>PRETTY LITTLE LIARS.</i>

2
00:00:03,104 --> 00:00:04,470
WHAT HAPPENED IN THE WOODS?

3
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:05,871
TOBY CAVANAUGH IS DEAD.

4
00:00:05,873 --> 00:00:08,874
SOMEBODY KILLED HIM.
I SAW HIS BODY.

5
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,309
AHH!
OH, GOD.

6
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:12,011
MAGGIE, I AM SO SORRY.

7
00:00:12,013 --> 00:00:14,179
DID PASTOR TED
HIRE SOMEBODY TO WORK
ON THE CHURCH?

8
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,115
Hannah: I PUT A FIVE DOLLAR BILL
IN THE CHURCH COLLECTION BOX,

9
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,783
IT HAD SOME DICE DRAWN ON IT.

10
00:00:17,785 --> 00:00:19,351
AND LATER THAT DAY,
CALEB'S DAD HAD IT.

11
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:20,719
DO YOU REALLY THINK HE
WOULD STEAL FROM THE PLACE

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,887
THAT JUST HIRED HIM?

13
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,889
THERE WAS SOME TROUBLE
WITH THE OLD BADGES.

14
00:00:23,891 --> 00:00:26,058
PEOPLE GETTING IN?
PEOPLE GETTING OUT?

15
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,527
EZRA FITZ HAS APPLIED
AS A SUBSTITUTE TEACHER.

16
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,330
I HAVE TO ASK,
ARE YOU SEEING EZRA FITS?

17
00:00:31,332 --> 00:00:31,330
NO, I'M NOT.

18
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,869
ALL I WANT FROM YOU
AND YOUR MOTHER IS THAT CAR.

19
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,405
LOOK AT ALL THAT'S HAPPENED
SINCE YOU TURNED ME DOWN

20
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:41,507
ON OUR LITTLE DRIVE
UP THE MOUNTAIN.

21
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,243
BUT I BELIEVE IN SECOND CHANCES.
YOU NEED ME.

22
00:00:48,715 --> 00:00:50,215
( door buzzing )

23
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:57,022
YOU HAVE VISITORS.

24
00:00:57,024 --> 00:00:58,757
SPENCER?

25
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,827
I'LL BE IN THE HALL
IF YOU NEED ME.

26
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:14,339
Emily: HEY. YOU KNEW
WE WERE COMING, RIGHT?

27
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:17,309
WE SPOKE WITH YOUR MOM.
WE WANTED TO BE HERE
THE FIRST DAY.

28
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:19,344
BUT SHE SAID YOU WERE GOING
TO BE HOME TOMORROW, SO...

29
00:01:19,346 --> 00:01:20,979
SHE STILL BELIEVES THAT?

30
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:24,016
SHE THINKS THAT I'LL BE ABLE
TO SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT

31
00:01:24,018 --> 00:01:27,886
IF I JUST TAKE A NICE BUBBLE
BATH AND LAY IN MY OWN BED?

32
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:32,458
I THINK WHAT SHE WANTS IS--
I KNOW WHAT SHE WANTS, BUT

33
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,594
THEY DON'T MAKE A LOOFA
THAT SCRAPES OUT
THE INSIDE OF YOUR HEAD.

34
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,634
THE PARK RANGERS FOUND A BODY.

35
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:44,269
Emily and Aria: HANNAH!
WHAT?

36
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,638
THE SOONER SHE KNOWS,
THE SOONER SHE CHECKS
OUT OF THIS PLACE.

37
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,544
WHAT HANNAH IS TRYING TO SAY
IS WE HAVE GOOD NEWS.

38
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:55,047
THEY FOUND A BODY
IN THE WOODS.

39
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,282
THE POLICE BELIEVE
IT WAS A CAMPER.

40
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:00,419
IT WAS TOBY.

41
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:04,690
NO, SPENCE, IT WASN'T.

42
00:02:04,692 --> 00:02:07,192
THIS PERSON, HE'D BEEN
MISSING FOR AWHILE

43
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:09,027
AND HE WAS NOWHERE NEAR WHERE
YOU THOUGHT YOU SAW--

44
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,196
I KNOW WHAT I SAW.

45
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:13,165
IT WAS TOBY.

46
00:02:18,238 --> 00:02:21,273
HEY, SO, UM,
I WAS THINKING
TOMORROW NIGHT

47
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,908
WHEN YOU GET HOME,
WE COULD ALL--

48
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,110
I NEED TO STAY HERE.
I NEED MORE TIME.

49
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:26,512
TIME FOR WHAT?

50
00:02:26,514 --> 00:02:27,713
HANNAH.

51
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:29,047
SHUFFLING AROUND IN
MONA'S OLD SLIPPERS

52
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:30,549
ISN'T GOING TO GET
HER ANY BETTER.

53
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,550
HANNAH, CHILL.

54
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:32,618
YOU KNOW WHAT...

55
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,319
I WOULD NOT DINE HERE,
IF I WERE YOU,

56
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,121
I HAD TO SNEAK AROUND
IN THAT KITCHEN,

57
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:38,557
AND I SAW A ROACH
BIG ENOUGH TO WEAR AN APRON.

58
00:02:38,559 --> 00:02:40,192
MOVING. ON.

59
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:42,961
YOU ARE NOT CRAZY.
THIS PLACE IS.

60
00:02:42,963 --> 00:02:45,697
I'M TOO TIRED TO HAVE
THIS FIGHT RIGHT NOW, GUYS.

61
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:52,070
I FEEL SAFE HERE.

62
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,040
THOSE BARS DON'T JUST KEEP
YOU FROM GETTING OUT,

63
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:58,110
THEY KEEP OTHER PEOPLE
FROM GETTING IN.

64
00:03:10,156 --> 00:03:12,224
( knocking on door )
UH, NEED A MINUTE.

65
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:17,095
YOUR FRIENDS ARE LEAVING.
DO YOU WANT TO SAY GOOD-BYE?

66
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,530
I ALREADY DID.

67
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:36,048
♪ GOT A SECRET,

68
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,550

75
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:58,270
Hannah: HAVE YOU SEEN
MY MAKE-UP BAG?

76
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,638
( sighs )
NO, BUT I THINK
EVERYTHING

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,273
THAT WAS IN IT
IS ON MY PILLOW.

78
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:03,242
OKAY, DON'T START.
I ONLY SLEPT FOR,

79
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:04,610
LIKE, 20 MINUTES.

80
00:04:04,612 --> 00:04:05,644
Emily: WHY DO YOU
KEEP LOOKING OUT THERE?

81
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:07,646
BECAUSE WILDEN KNOWS
I'M STAYING HERE.

82
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,147
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
THINKING ABOUT?

83
00:04:09,149 --> 00:04:10,749
I'M HAVING DREAMS ABOUT OUR
FRIEND HAVING HER HEAD SHAVED,

84
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,017
AND YOU'RE LOOKING--

85
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,018
I HAVE LOTS OF OTHER THINGS
THAT ARE KEEPING ME

86
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,820
UP AT NIGHT,
OKAY EMILY?

87
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,322
IF THAT CAR I DUNKED SUDDENLY
LEARNS HOW TO FLOAT, THEN--

88
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:18,323
IF WILDEN'S LOOKING
FOR HIS CAR,

89
00:04:18,325 --> 00:04:19,591
THEN HE'S NOT A.

90
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,393
OKAY, BESIDES CARS
DON'T FLOAT, IF THEY DID,

91
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,427
PILGRIMS COULD
HAVE DRIVEN HERE.

92
00:04:22,429 --> 00:04:23,929
WHY IS THERE
A WET TOWEL ON MY BED?

93
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,930
( knock on door )

94
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,265
Pam: LADIES,
YOU BETTER GET HOPPING,

95
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,799
OR YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO HAVE TIME FOR BREAKFAST.

96
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:30,569
Hannah:
OH, NONE FOR ME, THANKS.

97
00:04:30,571 --> 00:04:32,904
YOU KNOW I LOVE HER,
BUT SOMEBODY'S GOT TO TEACH

98
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,841
THAT GIRL THE WORD "FOLD."

99
00:04:35,843 --> 00:04:37,309
IT WAS A ROUGH NIGHT.

100
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:39,778
HONEY, LOOK. I KNOW IT'S HARD
SEEING A FRIEND SUFFER,

101
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,346
BUT IF THE DOCTOR'S
THINK SHE--

102
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:43,015
DOCTORS AREN'T
HELPING SPENCER.

103
00:04:43,017 --> 00:04:44,816
OKAY, SHE STILL
BELIEVES THAT WAS TOBY.

104
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,852
WELL, YOU CAN'T GET CAUGHT
UP IN THAT KIND OF THINKING.

105
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,954
DON'T TAKE ON A TRAGEDY THAT
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

106
00:04:48,956 --> 00:04:51,023
MOM! OKAY, YOU WORK
AT THE PRECINCT,

107
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:53,058
CAN YOU AT LEAST TELL ME WHEN
YOU KNOW MORE ABOUT THE BODY?

108
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,627
( sighs )
LOOK,

109
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,563
IF IT'LL HELP YOU
MOVE ON FROM THIS,

110
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,599
THEN YES.

111
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,702
YOU'LL KNOW WHEN I KNOW.

112
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:14,046
SURE IF THIS IS
BIG ENOUGH TO SPLIT?

113
00:05:14,048 --> 00:05:17,115
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
GO SIT INSIDE.

114
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,216
WE COULD ALSO EAT
THIS IN MY CAR

115
00:05:18,218 --> 00:05:19,985
AND DUCK EVERY TIME
SOMEBODY WALKS BY.

116
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,553
IF I'M TELLING THE PRINCIPAL
THAT WE'RE NOT INVOLVED,

117
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:23,288
I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD
BE SEEN SPLITTING

118
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:24,990
A CRULLER ON
THE SIDEWALK.
ALL RIGHT,

119
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,425
WE'RE NOT
GOING BACKWARDS.

120
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,859
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

121
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,595
LOOK...

122
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:33,065
NOTHING BETWEEN US
NEEDS TO CHANGE.

123
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,367
( phone ringing )

124
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:37,969
IT'S MAGGIE.

125
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,640
HEY, WHAT'S UP?

126
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,608
WHAT TIME?

127
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:49,681
TOMORROW...
UM, NO, I JUST HAVE A...

128
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:55,554
YOU KNOW WHAT, YEAH.
I CAN PICK HIM UP.

129
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:57,222
YEP.

130
00:05:57,224 --> 00:05:58,423
WHAT'S GOING ON?

131
00:05:58,425 --> 00:06:00,258
MALCOLM'S KARATE CLASS
GETS OUT AT THE SAME TIME

132
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:03,161
AS MY SECOND INTERVIEW.

133
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:07,132
WELL, I'D OFFER TO HELP,
I JUST FIGURED

134
00:06:07,134 --> 00:06:09,301
AFTER THE WHOLE
FALLING-OFF-THE-BED
INCIDENT--

135
00:06:09,303 --> 00:06:11,370
WELL, YOU KNOW
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR THAT.

136
00:06:11,372 --> 00:06:14,139
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

137
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:16,341
SO, MAGGIE BLAMES ME.
YOU KNOW WHAT,

138
00:06:16,343 --> 00:06:18,577
HONESTLY,
I WOULD LOVE IT IF
YOU PICKED UP MALCOLM.

139
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,412
IF I PUT OFF
THIS INTERVIEW,

140
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:22,481
SOMEONE ELSE IS
GOING TO GET THAT JOB.

141
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:23,615
( laughs )

142
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:25,484
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU
GOING TO TELL MAGGIE?

143
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:27,686
I CAN DEAL WITH HER.

144
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,557
AND WHAT'S EVEN TRIPPIER
IS WE BOTH HAVE SCARS

145
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:34,826
BELOW OUR LEFT KNEE.
AND, YOU KNOW, GRANTED,

146
00:06:34,828 --> 00:06:37,496
MY DAD GOT HIS
IN PRISON, BUT...

147
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:38,964
THAT WAS A JOKE.

148
00:06:38,966 --> 00:06:40,599
( laughs )

149
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:44,770
MMM, WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
NEW PERFUME?

150
00:06:44,772 --> 00:06:46,638
NO, IT'S AIR FRESHENER.

151
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,673
EMILY'S MOM SPRAYED IT
ALL OVER MY CLOTHES AND THEN,

152
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:51,510
WHEN I WASN'T LOOKING,
SHE SPRAYED IT IN MY HAIR.

153
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,744
ASK HER TO SPRITZ
YOU TONIGHT.

154
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,180
MY DAD WANTS TO TAKE US
TO A NICE DINNER.

155
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:58,984
CALEB, HE DOES NOT
HAVE TO DO THAT.

156
00:06:58,986 --> 00:07:01,720
STOP.

157
00:07:01,722 --> 00:07:03,221
LOOK, NOT ONLY ARE
YOU THE PERSON THAT

158
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:05,757
BROUGHT HIM BACK
INTO MY LIFE,

159
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,059
BUT YOU'RE THE REASON
HE GETS TO STAY IN IT.

160
00:07:09,228 --> 00:07:11,596
AND YOU GOT THE MAN WORK.

161
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,498
LET HIM GET YOU AN ENTRé.

162
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:33,585
CAN'T YOU JUST ASK YOUR MOM FOR
A COPY OF THE CORONER'S REPORT?

163
00:07:33,587 --> 00:07:35,120
ARIA, THE REPORT
DOESN'T SAY NOT TOBY,

164
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,555
IT SAYS JOHN DOE.

165
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:39,124
IT'S NOT GOING TO
CHANGE SPENCER'S MIND.

166
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,893
( phone rings )

167
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,330
WHO'S THAT?

168
00:07:45,332 --> 00:07:46,998
UM, SHANA.

169
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,134
WHY DOES SHE KEEP TEXTING YOU
WHILE PAIGE IS OUT OF TOWN?

170
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,335
IS SHE INTO YOU?

171
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,605
SORRY YOU GUYS,
CALEB HAD A LOT TO SHARE.

172
00:07:53,607 --> 00:07:54,606
WHY ARE YOU BLUSHING?

173
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:56,308
WHY IS SHE BLUSHING?

174
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:58,543
SHANA'S CRUISING HER,
AND I THINK THAT SHE
SHOULD SHUT IT DOWN

175
00:07:58,545 --> 00:08:00,278
BEFORE IT TURNS INTO
<i>EX AND THE CITY.</i>

176
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,113
GUYS, I'M NOT
THINKING ABOUT SHANA.

177
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,582
WE NEED TO HELP SPENCER.

178
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,217
NO, EM,
YOU SAW HER FACE.

179
00:08:05,219 --> 00:08:07,686
SHE'S NOT GETTING
OUT OF THERE
UNLESS WE KIDNAP HER.

180
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:10,822
OR WE ACTUALLY TAKE
THE BODY THERE AND PROVE
TO HER IT ISN'T TOBY.

181
00:08:13,392 --> 00:08:15,627
EM, THAT'S NOT
A REAL OPTION.

182
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,763
NO, BUT, TAKING
A PICTURE OF IT IS.

183
00:08:18,765 --> 00:08:20,265
AND WE'VE BEEN TO
THAT MORGUE BEFORE,

184
00:08:20,267 --> 00:08:22,334
WHAT'S STOPPING US
FROM GOING BACK?

185
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,971
UM, DO WE REALLY
HAVE TO ANSWER THAT?

186
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,375
Eddie:
EVER PLAYED THIS ONE?

187
00:08:30,377 --> 00:08:34,513
UM, NO. LOOKS LIKE IT'S
A BIT BEFORE MY TIME.

188
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,314
SO IS DUKE ELLINGTON.
IF HE WALKS IN THE DOOR,

189
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:38,583
ARE YOU GOING TO ASK HIM
NOT TO PLAY THE PIANO?

190
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:41,152
Wren: SPENCER? I JUST
LEARNED YOU'RE ADMITTED.

191
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:43,054
I DIDN'T KNOW.

192
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:45,357
EDDIE, UH, COULD YOU
CHECK ON MR. PATERSON?

193
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:47,492
HE MAY NEED ASSISTANCE
GETTING TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

194
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,760
HE HAD IT THIS MORNING.

195
00:08:48,762 --> 00:08:49,961
THEN, PERHAPS YOU
COULD DO A FOLLOW-UP,

196
00:08:49,963 --> 00:08:51,763
CHECK ON
HIS PAIN MANAGEMENT.

197
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,208
HOW'RE YOU FEELING?

198
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,509
UM...

199
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:10,015
SPENCER, IF THERE'S
ANYTHING I SAID OR DID THAT--

200
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,250
NO, YOU'RE NOT
THE REASON THAT I'M HERE.

201
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,087
WHO CHOSE THIS GAME?
YOU OR EDDIE?

202
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,355
EDDIE. WHY?

203
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:22,193
HE PLAYED IT WITH MONA,
WHEN SHE FIRST ARRIVED.

204
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,662
YEAH, SHE WAS
A BIT OBSESSED WITH IT,

205
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:26,231
UNTIL SHE EVENTUALLY
TRADED IT FOR CARDS.

206
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:29,034
( phone ringing )

207
00:09:29,036 --> 00:09:30,368
I'M AFRAID I'VE GOT
TO PUSH ON.

208
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:32,170
I'LL CHECK ON YOU LATER.

209
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,907
OKAY.

210
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:53,458
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

211
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,526
HANNAH?

212
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:59,030
I'VE LEFT YOUR MOM
SEVERAL MESSAGES
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD BACK.

213
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,833
IS THERE A BETTER WAY
THAT I CAN REACH HER?

214
00:10:01,835 --> 00:10:04,302
UH, SHE'S IN NEW YORK RIGHT
NOW FOR A TRAINING SEMINAR.

215
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:07,072
WHY, WHAT'S WRONG?

216
00:10:07,074 --> 00:10:11,109
WE JUST NEED HER TO WEIGH
IN ON A DELICATE ISSUE.

217
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,477
WHO'S WE?

218
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,249
MRS. MONTGOMERY,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

219
00:10:18,251 --> 00:10:20,018
( sighs )

220
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,087
I'M ON THE CHURCH'S
RESTORATION COMMITTEE,

221
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,989
AND SOMETHING'S COME UP.

222
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:26,358
WAIT, IS THIS
ABOUT CALEB'S DAD?

223
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,027
( sighs )

224
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,297
HOW WELL DID YOUR MOM
KNOW JAMIE BEFORE
SHE RECOMMENDED HIM?

225
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,034
LOOK, I'M TRYING TO HELP.

226
00:10:36,036 --> 00:10:37,802
IT'S JUST, IT'S REALLY
HARD TO DEFEND THE HONOR

227
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,471
OF SOMEONE
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW.

228
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:43,041
I'M HOPING IT'S ALL JUST
A BIG MISUNDERSTANDING.

229
00:10:43,043 --> 00:10:45,010
AND WHAT'S
THE MISUNDERSTANDING?

230
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:50,281
JAMIE...REMOVED
THE BRONZE BELL
FROM THE TOWER

231
00:10:50,283 --> 00:10:52,550
TO HAVE IT REPAIRED,
BUT THE ONE THAT WAS

232
00:10:52,552 --> 00:10:56,521
RETURNED IS EVIDENTLY
OF MUCH LESSER VALUE.

233
00:10:56,523 --> 00:10:58,523
WAIT, THAT'S WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

234
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,892
THEY MISS THEIR OLD,
CRUSTY BELL?

235
00:11:00,894 --> 00:11:03,928
TO THE TUNE OF $8,000.

236
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:07,198
PLEASE, DON'T SAY
ANYTHING TO CALEB,

237
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,901
JUST HAVE YOUR
MOM CALL ME.

238
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,924
IT'S GOT GREAT BONES.

239
00:12:39,926 --> 00:12:41,693
THEY BUILT THESE CHURCHES
TO LAST.

240
00:12:41,695 --> 00:12:43,628
WHEN DO THEY EXPECT
YOU TO BE DONE?

241
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:45,230
I'M GOING TO TAKE MY TIME.

242
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,965
I WANT TO GET THIS RIGHT.

243
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:51,503
OH, BEFORE I FORGET.

244
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,977
WHAT IS THIS?

245
00:12:58,979 --> 00:13:00,044
IT'S FOR YOU.

246
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,881
OPEN IT.

247
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:08,119
IT'S AN ANGEL.

248
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,621
IT SEEMED APPROPRIATE.

249
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:12,290
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

250
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,591
( phone ringing )

251
00:13:13,593 --> 00:13:16,327
OH, I HATE
THESE DAMN THINGS.

252
00:13:16,329 --> 00:13:18,096
LET ME TURN THIS OFF.

253
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:22,934
ACTUALLY, IT'S PASTOR TED.

254
00:13:22,936 --> 00:13:24,569
I MAY HAVE TO GET THIS,
EXCUSE ME.

255
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:28,439
HELLO?

256
00:13:31,277 --> 00:13:33,711
Veronica: I THOUGHT THIS MIGHT
MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

257
00:13:33,713 --> 00:13:35,180
AND THEN MAYBE ON
THE WAY HOME, WE CAN STOP--

258
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,583
I'M NOT COMING HOME.
JUST AT LEAST PUT
ON THE BLOUSE.

259
00:13:38,585 --> 00:13:41,719
MOM, I TOLD YOU
I'M NOT READY.

260
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,588
WELL, AS SOON AS YOU'RE
IN YOUR OWN BEDROOM,

261
00:13:43,590 --> 00:13:44,689
SURROUNDED BY YOUR--
LOOK, MOM,

262
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:47,192
I CAN'T JUST GO BACK
TO DINNERS AT THE CLUB.

263
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:49,093
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WEAR
THE BLAZER, JUST PUT ON THE--

264
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,595
( yelling)
I SAID I'M NOT READY!

265
00:14:15,054 --> 00:14:17,622
WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
YOU AND TOBY?

266
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,696
I'M NOT MOVING FROM THIS SPOT
UNTIL I GET A REAL ANSWER.

267
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,735
THE LAST TIME I SAW
SOMEONE IN THIS STATE,

268
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:33,338
CLINGING TO A SECRET
THIS HARD, IT WAS ALISON.

269
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,243
A FEW WEEKS LATER
SHE WAS DEAD.

270
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,949
( door opens )

271
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,352
( sighs )
ALISON.

272
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:50,488
WHERE WERE YOU?
I THOUGHT YOU WERE

273
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,723
ASLEEP IN SPENCER'S ROOM.

274
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,460
I HAD TO GO OUT.

275
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:56,594
FOR WHAT?

276
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:00,899
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR MOUTH?
IT'S BLEEDING.

277
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:04,469
I MUST'VE SCRATCHED
MYSELF ON A TREE BRANCH

278
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,237
ON MY WAY OVER
TO THE HOUSE.

279
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,373
CAN I GO UPSTAIRS,
PLEASE?

280
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:10,508
WHY DID YOU HAVE TO GO TO YOUR
HOUSE AT THREE IN THE MORNING?

281
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:14,512
MRS. HASTINGS, PLEASE.
I CAN'T TALK ABOUT THIS.

282
00:15:14,514 --> 00:15:16,981
LET ME GET SOME ICE
FOR YOUR MOUTH.
JUST STAY THERE.

283
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,516
PLEASE?

284
00:15:24,623 --> 00:15:25,890
HERE.

285
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,894
DID YOU HAVE A FIGHT
WITH SOMEONE?

286
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:33,364
MRS. HASTINGS, IF YOU
TELL MY PARENTS,

287
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,832
IT'S ONLY GOING
TO MAKE IT WORSE.

288
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,304
PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
SAY ANYTHING.

289
00:15:43,976 --> 00:15:45,510
COME HERE.

290
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,916
SHH.

291
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,688
I'M JUST BEING WEIRD.

292
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:01,192
OVERLY SENSITIVE.
I'M FINE.

293
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,702
YOU NEVER TOLD THIS
TO THE POLICE?

294
00:16:10,704 --> 00:16:12,370
OF COURSE I DID.

295
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,809
BUT I MADE UP MY OWN MIND ABOUT
WHO WENT AFTER HER THAT NIGHT

296
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,444
AND I KEPT THAT TO MYSELF.

297
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:20,611
WELL, WHO?

298
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:22,947
WHY? MOM, HOW COULD
YOU NOT SAY ANYTHING?

299
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:25,083
BECAUSE IF JASON
WENT AFTER US,

300
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:28,119
EXPOSING YOUR FATHER
AS HIS, TOO,

301
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,989
IT'D BE MY FAMILY BREAKING DOWN
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

302
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,660
SO, YOU STILL
BELIEVE JASON?

303
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:38,129
NO, I DON'T.
NOT ANYMORE.

304
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,532
BUT I'M STARTING
TO WONDER ABOUT OTHERS.

305
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:46,971
I NEED TO ASK.

306
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,876
IS TOBY NOT THE PERSON
THAT WE THOUGHT HE WAS?

307
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,824
SORRY, GUYS, I'M GOING
TO HAVE TO HIT THE ROAD.

308
00:17:06,826 --> 00:17:09,027
THERE'S A PROBLEM AT WORK
I GOTTA DEAL WITH.

309
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,061
WHAT, RIGHT NOW?

310
00:17:10,063 --> 00:17:12,230
I'VE JUST BEEN FIRED.

311
00:17:12,232 --> 00:17:14,265
WHAT--WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

312
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,136
IT SEEMS THE WRONG BELL
GOT HUNG UP IN THE TOWER...

313
00:17:18,138 --> 00:17:21,239
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GO DOWN
TO THE FOUNDRY MYSELF
AND CLEAR THIS UP.

314
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:22,540
DO YOU WANT ME
TO COME WITH YOU?

315
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,509
NO, YOU GUYS
FINISH YOUR DINNER,

316
00:17:24,511 --> 00:17:27,011
I'LL SORT THIS OUT.
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

317
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,253
( door closing )

318
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,223
OKAY, WHO AM I SUPPOSED
TO TEXT IF I SEE SOMEONE?

319
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:13,624
ME. NOT HANNAH.

320
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:15,960
WE'RE USING HER PHONE
TO TAKE THE PICTURE.

321
00:18:15,962 --> 00:18:17,762
HANNAH, PAY ATTENTION.

322
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:20,064
WHAT? I'M SORRY.

323
00:18:20,066 --> 00:18:22,600
MY BOYFRIEND'S DAD
GOT NAILED FOR STEALING.

324
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,735
WHERE DO YOU SELL
A HOT BELL, ANYWAY?

325
00:18:24,737 --> 00:18:25,736
HANNAH, FOCUS.
I DON'T WANT TO BE

326
00:18:25,738 --> 00:18:27,405
IN THERE ANY LONGER
THAN WE HAVE TO.

327
00:18:27,407 --> 00:18:30,441
WE FIND JOHN DOE,
WE TAKE THE PICTURE,
AND WE GET OUT OF HERE.

328
00:18:30,443 --> 00:18:32,610
IF IT'S BRONZE,
YOU PROBABLY MELT
IT DOWN FIRST.

329
00:18:32,612 --> 00:18:34,045
MELT IT INTO WHAT?

330
00:18:34,047 --> 00:18:35,413
WHY ARE WE STILL
DISCUSSING BELLS?

331
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:37,882
BECAUSE CALEB THINKS
HIS DAD IS A SAINT,

332
00:18:37,884 --> 00:18:40,418
AND I KNOW HE'S SELLING PIECES
OF OUR CHURCH ONLINE.

333
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,153
OKAY, FORGET IT.
I'LL DO THIS ALONE.

334
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,433
Hannah: HOW ARE WE GONNA KNOW
WHICH ONE IS JOHN DOE?

335
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,101
Emily: WE HAVE TO GO
THROUGH THOSE RACKS.

336
00:18:57,103 --> 00:18:59,737
UM, NO.
YOU ARE GOING
THROUGH THOSE RACKS.

337
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:03,007
THIS ISN'T A CLEARANCE SALE,
EMILY, AND I'M FREAKING OUT.

338
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,475
ALL WE'VE DONE IS WALK
THROUGH THOSE DOORS.

339
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:07,778
IT DOESN'T MATTER!
I SMELL DEAD PEOPLE.

340
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,783
FINE, JUST GET
YOUR PHONE READY, OKAY?

341
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:16,554
I'LL HOLD IT,
BUT YOU HAVE TO AIM IT.

342
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:19,323
I JUST WANT TO
CLOSE MY EYES.

343
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:33,137
Hannah:
GOD, THIS IS SO WRONG.

344
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:36,407
YOU SPEND YOUR WHOLE LIFE
DOING CRUNCHES,

345
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:41,646
GETTING RID OF TAN LINES,
NOT EATING THAT SECOND PUDDING.

346
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:44,849
AND THEN IN THE END YOU'RE
JUST A STALE LOAF OF BREAD

347
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,751
LYING ON A RACK.

348
00:19:46,753 --> 00:19:48,186
UM, MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME
WITH THIS LOAF,

349
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,954
I CAN'T FIND
THE TAG.
WAIT.

350
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,291
EM, WHAT IF IT REALLY
IS TOBY IN THERE?

351
00:19:53,293 --> 00:19:57,562
IT'S NOT. AND SPENCER
NEEDS TO KNOW THAT.

352
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,131
'KAY, BUT JUST IN CASE,
I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN

353
00:20:00,133 --> 00:20:03,034
HANDLE SEEING HIS FACE.
SO CAN WE JUST LOOK FOR

354
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,770
HIS TATTOO,
OR SOMETHING?

355
00:20:05,772 --> 00:20:07,171
IT'S NOT TOBY!

356
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,716
( cell phone beeps )

357
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,158
( door closes )

358
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:33,030
( elevator bell dings )

359
00:20:41,873 --> 00:20:43,407
Emily:
AHH!

360
00:20:49,648 --> 00:20:52,049
( cell phone rings )

361
00:20:52,051 --> 00:20:53,284
EM, SOMEONE'S COMING.

362
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,485
COME ON, WE HAVE TO GO.

363
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,555
EM, COME ON!

364
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:06,964
( knocking on door )

365
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,165
HI, SUNSHINE.

366
00:21:08,167 --> 00:21:10,101
HEY.

367
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:11,769
GOOD BOOK?

368
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,237
IT'S OKAY.

369
00:21:13,239 --> 00:21:15,973
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

370
00:21:15,975 --> 00:21:18,676
THAT GAME THAT YOU WANTED
TO PLAY YESTERDAY?

371
00:21:18,678 --> 00:21:21,712
I HEARD IT WAS ONE OF
MONA'S FAVORITES.

372
00:21:21,714 --> 00:21:23,981
WHO PLAYED IT WITH HER?

373
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,383
I DON'T RECALL.

374
00:21:25,385 --> 00:21:27,685
MONA LIKED TO PLAY
A LOT OF GAMES.

375
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,186
YEAH, BUT WREN...

376
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:31,489
DR. KINGSTON,
HE SAID SHE WAS

377
00:21:31,491 --> 00:21:32,923
"OBSESSED" WITH
THIS ONE.

378
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:35,226
WELL, HE WOULD KNOW.

379
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:38,062
WHAT IS WITH YOU AND HIM?

380
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:41,232
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

381
00:21:41,234 --> 00:21:45,970
EDDIE, ARE YOU THE PERSON
BEHIND THE TROUBLE

382
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,738
WITH THE VISITORS' PASSES?

383
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,240
DID YOU LET
SOMEBODY IN WHO--

384
00:21:49,242 --> 00:21:51,709
IT WASN'T ME.

385
00:21:51,711 --> 00:21:53,044
WAS IT DR. KINGSTON?

386
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,114
TAKE YOUR PILL.

387
00:21:57,116 --> 00:21:58,249
YOU MAY BE SLEEPING,
BUT YOU DON'T LOOK

388
00:21:58,251 --> 00:21:59,283
LIKE YOU'RE
GETTING ANY REST.

389
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:00,785
I WON'T TELL ANYBODY.

390
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:05,156
TRUST YOUR INSTINCT.
MINE TOLD ME,

391
00:22:05,158 --> 00:22:06,590
FROM THE MINUTE
THAT GUY GOT HERE,

392
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,159
IT WASN'T FOR
THE RIGHT REASONS.

393
00:22:09,961 --> 00:22:11,962
LET'S JUST
LEAVE IT AT THAT, OKAY?

394
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:11,389
HEY.

395
00:23:11,391 --> 00:23:13,124
DID YOU GET MY MESSAGES?

396
00:23:13,126 --> 00:23:14,458
YEAH, I'VE BEEN
CRAMMING FOR ALGEBRA.

397
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,360
I HAVE A MAKE-UP TEST IN,
LIKE, TEN MINUTES.

398
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:17,995
WELL, MY DAD'S SCREWED.

399
00:23:17,997 --> 00:23:19,797
THE FOUNDRY CLAIMS
THERE IS NO MIX-UP,

400
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,032
AND THEY HAVE
THE PAPER TRAIL TO PROVE IT.

401
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:24,335
WELL, MAYBE IF
YOUR FATHER SPOKE TO
THE CHURCH COMMITTEE,

402
00:23:24,337 --> 00:23:26,637
AND TOLD THEM THAT--
TOLD THEM WHAT?

403
00:23:26,639 --> 00:23:28,406
WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO DEFEND
HIMSELF TO A BUNCH OF

404
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:30,608
SMALL-MINDED PEOPLE WHO
THINK SOMEONE IS A THIEF

405
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,643
JUST BECAUSE THEY
DON'T TUCK IN THEIR SHIRT?

406
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,782
DID I PRESS
MUTE OR SOMETHING?

407
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:38,916
WHY ARE YOU BEING SO QUIET?

408
00:23:39,851 --> 00:23:42,019
I'M JUST LISTENING.

409
00:23:42,021 --> 00:23:43,888
YOU DID A LOT OF
THAT LAST NIGHT, TOO.

410
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:48,492
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, CALEB.

411
00:23:48,494 --> 00:23:50,928
SINCE WHEN?
HANNAH YOU HAVE
AN OPINION ABOUT

412
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,164
EVERYTHING,
FROM HONEY BOO-BOO'S
HAIR CUT

413
00:23:53,166 --> 00:23:55,499
TO THE WEIRD LOOK
THE LUNCH LADY
GAVE YOU WHEN

414
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:57,201
YOU ASKED FOR
BUTTER ON YOUR CORN.

415
00:23:57,203 --> 00:23:59,036
LOOK, I JUST
DON'T THINK THAT

416
00:23:59,038 --> 00:24:00,838
YOUR DAD HAS
CHANGED AS MUCH

417
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:02,706
AS MUCH AS YOU
THINK HE HAS.

418
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,147
LOOK, THE NIGHT
THAT HE GOT THE JOB
AT THE CHURCH,

419
00:24:10,149 --> 00:24:13,050
I PUT MONEY IN
THE CHURCH COLLECTION BOX,

420
00:24:13,052 --> 00:24:17,221
AND WHEN HE PAID
FOR THE PIZZA,
HE USED THAT SAME BILL.

421
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:20,624
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY KNOW THAT?

422
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:24,562
BECAUSE THERE WAS A PAIR
OF LUCKY DICE DRAWN ON IT.

423
00:24:24,564 --> 00:24:26,197
IT WAS THE SAME BILL,
CALEB.

424
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,170
( school bell rings )

425
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,310
( scattered chattering )

426
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:46,150
HI. EXCUSE ME, YEAH,
I'M HERE TO PICK UP MALCOLM.

427
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:48,652
OH, HE WAS ALREADY PICKED UP
ABOUT TEN MINUTES AGO.

428
00:24:48,654 --> 00:24:51,222
HE WAS?
OH, SO MAGGIE MUST HAVE--

429
00:24:51,224 --> 00:24:53,457
OH, NO, HIS MOM DIDN'T COME
TODAY, IT WAS A FRIEND.

430
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:56,060
UH, ARIA MONTGOMERY.

431
00:24:57,596 --> 00:24:59,096
SOMETHING WRONG?

432
00:24:59,098 --> 00:25:01,999
NO. NO,
EVERYTHING'S FINE, THANKS.

433
00:25:17,616 --> 00:25:20,317
( carnival music playing )

434
00:25:20,319 --> 00:25:22,386
( children laughing )

435
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,725
( laughing )

436
00:25:42,607 --> 00:25:46,110
Carnival barker:
KNOCK THEM DOWN AND WIN A PRIZE!

437
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:48,846
( carnival barker continues )

438
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,454
( laughter )

439
00:25:57,456 --> 00:25:59,523
Ella:
ARIA?

440
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,792
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
COMING HERE TONIGHT.

441
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,428
YEAH, I'M CAME TO MEET UP
WITH EZRA AND MALCOLM.

442
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,130
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

443
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,998
IS MAGGIE HERE, TOO?

444
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,999
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE.

445
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:10,301
HONEY, WE TALKED
ABOUT THIS.

446
00:26:10,303 --> 00:26:12,303
AND I KNOW YOU WANT
TO MAKE IT WORK, BUT--

447
00:26:12,305 --> 00:26:14,872
OKAY, MOM, I CAN'T
DO THIS RIGHT NOW.
ARIA!

448
00:26:14,874 --> 00:26:16,740
YOU'RE GOING TO BE
THE ONE THAT GETS HURT.

449
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:19,443
NOT TO MENTION
A CONFUSED LITTLE BOY
WHO'S STILL WONDERING

450
00:26:19,445 --> 00:26:21,845
HOW THIS STRANGER
IS SUDDENLY HIS FATHER.

451
00:26:21,847 --> 00:26:24,615
HE NEEDS HELP
WORKING THROUGH IT,
BUT NOT WITH YOU.

452
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:27,318
MALCOLM ALREADY
HAS SOMEBODY LOOKING
OUT FOR HIM.

453
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,687
I HAVE TO GO.

454
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:51,875
BE RIGHT BACK, I'M GOING
TO DROP THIS OFF TO ROOM 217.

455
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,812
WHAT IS THAT?

456
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:56,146
A BOOK.

457
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:58,048
ONE OF THE PATIENTS WAS
ASKING FOR IT EARLIER, SO--

458
00:26:58,050 --> 00:26:59,249
YES, WELL, OUR PATIENT
NEEDS HER REST.

459
00:26:59,251 --> 00:27:01,118
YOU CAN GIVE IT
TO SPENCER TOMORROW.

460
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:04,755
I'M OFF TOMORROW.

461
00:27:04,757 --> 00:27:06,290
ALL RIGHT, THEN I'LL
GIVE IT TO HER FOR YOU.

462
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:13,731
WE'RE NOT HAVING THE SAME
PROBLEM AGAIN, ARE WE, EDDIE?

463
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:17,134
( fair music playing )

464
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,387
HAVE YOU HEARD
ANYTHING YET?

465
00:27:36,389 --> 00:27:37,855
NOPE.
( phone rings )

466
00:27:37,857 --> 00:27:39,523
FOR ALL I KNOW,
HE'S ALREADY SKIPPED TOWN.

467
00:27:39,525 --> 00:27:40,591
WELL, I SPOKE TO MY MOM--

468
00:27:40,593 --> 00:27:42,693
HANNAH, IT'S NOT UP
TO YOUR MOM

469
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,963
OR YOU, OR ME TO
DIG HIM OUT OF THIS.

470
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,598
IS THIS EVERYTHING?

471
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,533
YEAH, ALMOST.
JUST TO FIND MY ENGLISH BOOK.

472
00:27:49,535 --> 00:27:51,468
ALL RIGHT,
I'LL BE OUT FRONT.

473
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:56,440
( door bell rings )

474
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,810
Jamie: HEY.

475
00:27:59,812 --> 00:28:02,246
I WAS ON MY WAY TO YOUR PLACE,
AND I SAW YOUR CAR OUT FRONT.

476
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:03,647
WHERE WERE YOU?

477
00:28:03,649 --> 00:28:06,216
OH, MAKING PHONE CALLS...
HEY.

478
00:28:06,218 --> 00:28:07,551
WAS TRYING TO TRACK DOWN
A GUY WHO HELPED ME

479
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:10,754
WITH THE DRY WALL.
AND SEE IF HE CAN HELP...

480
00:28:10,756 --> 00:28:13,390
HELP WITH WHAT?
BACK UP YOUR STORY?

481
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:14,458
WHAT'S HIS CUT?

482
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,960
WHAT?

483
00:28:16,962 --> 00:28:19,129
CALEB,
DON'T DO THIS RIGHT NOW.

484
00:28:19,131 --> 00:28:20,130
HEY, YOU SHOULD LISTEN
TO YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

485
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,565
I AM.

486
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:23,567
AND I BELIEVE HER
WHEN SHE SAYS THIS
ISN'T THE FIRST TIME

487
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:25,035
THAT YOU'VE STOLEN
FROM THAT CHURCH.

488
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,770
WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT HERE?

489
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:29,640
WE AREN'T TALKING.
WE ARE DONE.

490
00:28:29,642 --> 00:28:31,475
LAST NIGHT,
YOU WERE MY DEFENDER.

491
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,277
WHAT HAPPENED?
I WOKE UP,

492
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:36,146
AND I REALIZED THAT
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME
THAT YOU'VE SCREWED ME OVER.

493
00:28:36,148 --> 00:28:37,981
OH, I SEE.

494
00:28:37,983 --> 00:28:40,451
I'M STILL THAT PERSON,
HUH?

495
00:28:40,453 --> 00:28:42,352
SOMEHOW YOU MANAGED
TO FORGIVE YOUR MOTHER'S SINS.

496
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:45,022
DON'T SUPPOSE IT'S GOT ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THAT FANCY CAR

497
00:28:45,024 --> 00:28:46,190
SHE TOSSED AT YOU.

498
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,592
THAT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

499
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:52,029
MAYBE NOT, BUT IT'S GOT TO
BE EASIER TO POINT A FINGER

500
00:28:52,031 --> 00:28:55,833
AT SOMEONE WITH A RUSTY PICK-UP
AND NO PERMANENT ADDRESS.

501
00:28:55,835 --> 00:28:57,401
ISN'T THAT ALL
THE PROOF YOU NEEDED?

502
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:01,939
ALL THE PROOF THAT I NEEDED
WERE THE RATTY HAND-ME-DOWNS

503
00:29:01,941 --> 00:29:03,073
THAT I HAD AS A KID.

504
00:29:03,075 --> 00:29:05,542
REMEMBER THE WINTER COAT
THAT ENDED AT MY ELBOW?

505
00:29:05,544 --> 00:29:07,377
AND THE UNSIGNED
PERMISSION SLIPS?

506
00:29:07,379 --> 00:29:10,013
AND THE SOCIAL WORKERS,
AND THE FOSTER FAMILIES

507
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:13,150
WHO SLAMMED DOORS IN
MY FACE WHEN THEY WERE
TIRED OF LOOKING AT ME?

508
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:15,052
THAT IS MY PROOF!

509
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,059
YEAH.

510
00:29:22,061 --> 00:29:26,029
WOW, WHEN YOU
PUT IT THAT WAY...

511
00:29:26,031 --> 00:29:28,432
I GUESS I WOULDN'T
BELIEVE ME, EITHER.

512
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,276
Aria:
<i>SHOULD I CALL THE POLICE?</i>

513
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,711
Emily:
<i>YES. WAIT.</i>

514
00:29:40,713 --> 00:29:42,312
<i>UNLESS YOU THINK</i>
<i>IT WILL MAKE IT WORSE.</i>

515
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:45,015
WHAT'S WORSE?
A'S GOT EZRA'S KID.

516
00:29:45,017 --> 00:29:47,384
<i>I'M JUST SAYING, YOU SAW THEM,</i>
<i>MALCOLM WASN'T HURT.</i>

517
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,019
<i>BUT IF YOU CALL THE COPS,</i>
<i>A MIGHT--</i>

518
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,487
DON'T. JUST DON'T.

519
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,489
OKAY, I SWEAR, IF SOMETHING
HAPPENS TO THAT LITTLE BOY

520
00:29:52,491 --> 00:29:54,024
BECAUSE OF ME, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.

521
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:56,193
<i>ARIA. WALK OVER TO</i>
<i>THE POLICE STATION,</i>

522
00:29:56,195 --> 00:29:58,629
<i>AND REPORT IT.</i>
<i>I'LL MEET YOU THERE IN TEN.</i>

523
00:29:59,898 --> 00:30:01,165
( sighs )

524
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:26,056
MALCOLM?

525
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:29,293
THERE'S GONNA BE ANOTHER SHOW.
THE MAN OUTSIDE SAID SO.

526
00:30:29,295 --> 00:30:30,928
I'M EARLY.

527
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:44,441
YOU KNOW, I WAS SUPPOSED
TO PICK YOU UP FROM YOUR
KARATE CLASS, RIGHT?

528
00:30:44,443 --> 00:30:46,643
BUT YOUR FRIEND
PICKED ME UP INSTEAD.

529
00:30:46,645 --> 00:30:48,579
SHE SAID HER NAME
WAS ALISON.

530
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:54,985
COME ON, WE SHOULD GO.

531
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,888
YOUR DAD'S PROBABLY
WONDERING WHERE WE ARE.

532
00:31:15,773 --> 00:31:17,975
( phone ringing )

533
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,047
EMILY?

534
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:27,184
UM, MOM, I FIGURED
YOU'D BE HOME BY NOW.

535
00:31:27,186 --> 00:31:29,386
I THOUGHT I WAS
CLEAR THIS MORNING.

536
00:31:29,388 --> 00:31:31,788
LOOK, I KNOW YOU WANT ANSWERS,
BUT YOU CAN'T BE DOING THIS.

537
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,326
GO HOME.
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THIS LATER.

538
00:31:36,328 --> 00:31:38,128
WHAT'S GOING ON?

539
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:39,129
THIS IS NOT THE TIME.

540
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,163
WHY ARE THEY MAKING
YOU STAY LATE?

541
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:41,965
EMILY, GO.

542
00:31:41,967 --> 00:31:44,601
I'LL CALL YOU
WHEN I'M ON MY WAY.

543
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:14,998
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR...

544
00:32:33,151 --> 00:32:35,719
( humming coming
from the distance )

545
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,364
( humming continues )

546
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:01,511
( humming getting louder )

547
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,123
DIDN'T YOUR MOTHER HAVE THIS?

548
00:33:14,392 --> 00:33:15,592
YOUR MOTHER.

549
00:33:15,594 --> 00:33:18,028
REALLY, I MUST HAVE
LEFT IT AT YOUR HOUSE

550
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,629
AND DIDN'T GET IT BACK.

551
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:22,299
I LEFT A LOT
OF STUFF THERE.

552
00:33:22,301 --> 00:33:26,103
IS IT JUST ME, OR WAS
SIXTH GRADE THE BEST YEAR EVER?

553
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:29,206
I DIDN'T EVEN
KNOW YOU THEN.

554
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,307
OH, HONEY,

555
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:32,976
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
ME WHEN YOU KNEW ME.

556
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,680
( music starts playing )

557
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,217
COME ON, GIVE IT UP,
SPENCE.

558
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,284
LET'S PRETEND THAT YOU'RE
GETTING READY FOR

559
00:33:41,286 --> 00:33:43,954
YOUR FIRST BOY-GIRL
DANCE PARTY.

560
00:33:47,125 --> 00:33:49,026
NO ONE EVER TELLS
YOU THAT THE PRACTICE

561
00:33:49,028 --> 00:33:51,628
IS SO MUCH MORE FUN
THAN THE REAL THING.

562
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:55,198
Spencer:
WAS IT TOBY?

563
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,503
WAS HE THE ONE THAT
GAVE YOU THAT BLOODY LIP?

564
00:33:59,505 --> 00:34:02,005
TOBY?

565
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:03,974
OH, SWEETIE,

566
00:34:03,976 --> 00:34:06,676
GIRLS FIGHT MUCH
DIRTIER THAN BOYS.

567
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:10,914
I'M LUCKY SHE
DIDN'T LEAVE A SCAR.

568
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:15,052
SHE? WHO?

569
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:16,853
YOU STOPPED DANCING.

570
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,722
I DON'T--
I DON'T WANT TO DANCE.

571
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,157
I'LL CHANGE THE SONG.

572
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,393
NO, I CAN'T.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN THREE DAYS.

573
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:26,763
COME ON.
I'M LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING.

574

YOU'RE MALCOLM'S

HE HAD A BLAST TONIGHT.

WHAT DID HE SAY?

584
00:35:57,856 --> 00:36:00,390
AH, NOT MUCH.
MAGGIE SAID HE

MUMBLED SOMETHING

YOU KNOW, IF YOU KEEP
SPOILING HIM LIKE THIS,

590

HE'S NOT GOING TO WANT

I WOULDN'T KNOW.
YES, YOU WOULD, WREN.

YOU AUTHORIZED IT.

AND I WAS ALMOST
SUSPENDED FOR IT.

612

CECE CALLED ME AND WAS
DESPERATE TO SEE HER.

YOU SURE IT WASN'T
THE OTHER WAY AROUND?

620
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:07,183
QUITE SURE. ALISON PULLED
SOME STUNT AT A FRAT PARTY

621
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,319
THAT GOT CECE KICKED OUT
OF UNIVERSITY.

622
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:14,424
ALLIE... GOT CECE
KICKED OUT OF SCHOOL?

623
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,892
YEAH, CECE CAME OUT
THE OTHER SIDE,

624
00:38:15,894 --> 00:38:19,529
AND SHE THOUGHT SHE COULD
SERVE AS A ROLE MODEL FOR MONA.

625
00:38:19,531 --> 00:38:21,564
AND I AGREED.

626
00:38:21,566 --> 00:38:24,067
HOW DID SHE EVEN KNOW
THAT MONA WAS EVEN IN HERE?

627
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:27,604
MELISSA CALLED HER.

628
00:38:30,408 --> 00:38:31,608
( knock on door )

629
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,478
EMILY?
IS HANNAH HOME?

630
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,914
NO. SHE'S OUT
WITH CALEB, WHY?

631
00:38:40,184 --> 00:38:41,484
MOM?

632
00:38:41,486 --> 00:38:43,353
WHAT'S GOING ON?

633
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,989
WHY WERE YOU CARRYING
THAT MISSING PERSONS FILE?

634
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:50,760
I PROMISED I WOULDN'T
KEEP ANYTHING FROM YOU.

635
00:38:50,762 --> 00:38:54,431
BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE
THAT YOU KEEP THIS
FROM YOUR FRIENDS.

636
00:38:55,866 --> 00:38:57,233
CAN I HAVE YOUR PHONE,
PLEASE?

637
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,469
WHAT?

638
00:38:59,471 --> 00:39:00,837
THIS IS VERY SENSITIVE
INFORMATION,

639
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,073
IF IT GOT OUT BEFORE
THE POLICE--
MOM.

640
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,808
PLEASE, WHAT IS IT?

641
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:11,681
THEY FOUND ANOTHER BODY
EARLY THIS EVENING.

642
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,852
A YOUNG MAN.

643
00:39:15,854 --> 00:39:18,388
LATE TEENS, EARLY 20S.

644
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,056
NO IDENTIFICATION.

645
00:39:21,926 --> 00:39:24,694
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

646
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:26,629
IT COULD BE TOBY?

647
00:39:26,631 --> 00:39:28,498
I DON'T KNOW.

648
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,633
HOW CAN THEY NOT KNOW?

649
00:39:30,635 --> 00:39:33,803
THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT TRAUMA
TO THE BODY, EMILY.

650
00:39:35,973 --> 00:39:38,808
IT'S GONNA TAKE SOME TIME
BEFORE THEY'RE CERTAIN.

651
00:39:41,011 --> 00:39:43,380
WE'LL KNOW MORE
TOMORROW MORNING.

652
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,766
♪

653
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:14,077
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE
A WALK OR SOMETHING?

654
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:19,549
IT WAS STUPID.

655
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,552
YOU GAVE SOMEONE
A SECOND CHANCE.

656
00:40:22,554 --> 00:40:24,454
THAT'S NEVER STUPID.

657
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:28,558
WE TALKED ABOUT
THIS ROAD TRIP
WE WERE GONNA TAKE.

658
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:30,360
RIDE BIKES,
GO OUT WEST.

659
00:40:30,362 --> 00:40:33,596
( sighing )

660
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,532
I WAS ALREADY
MAPPING IT OUT.

661
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,769
WE CAN TAKE
A TRIP SOMETIME.

662
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:43,640
I KNOW IT'S NOT
THE SAME, BUT--
IT WOULD BE BETTER.

663
00:40:43,642 --> 00:40:46,443
BECAUSE I'LL BE WITH SOMEONE WHO
I KNOW IS LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

664
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:58,354
I'LL GET US REFILLS.

665
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:09,632
( bell tolling )

666
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:11,901
( phone ringing )

667
00:41:13,737 --> 00:41:16,039
( bell continues tolling )

668
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:36,125
SO, BASICALLY A WAS FRAMING
JAMIE THE WHOLE TIME?

669
00:41:36,127 --> 00:41:37,994
DO YOU THINK THAT BILL FROM
THE COLLECTION BOX WAS--

670
00:41:37,996 --> 00:41:40,096
DON'T YOU?

671
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:42,765
CALEB IS NEVER GOING
TO FORGIVE ME.

672
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:44,334
WHERE IS HE NOW?

673
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:45,935
HE WENT TO GO FIND JAMIE.

674
00:41:45,937 --> 00:41:48,037
BUT EVEN IF HE DOES,
WHAT IS HE SUPPOSED
TO TELL HIM?

675
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:51,674
HE MAY JUST HAVE TO FIND
A WAY TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH.

676
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:55,044
CALEB'S FAMILIAR WITH
THE WORKINGS OF A.

677
00:41:55,046 --> 00:41:56,379
SO IS EZRA.

678
00:41:56,381 --> 00:41:57,814
DO YOU PLAN ON
TELLING HIM WHO
BOUGHT HIS KID

679
00:41:57,816 --> 00:42:00,116
A BIG,
FAT BALLOON TODAY?

680
00:42:00,118 --> 00:42:02,018
( knock on door )

681
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,988
Aria: EM?
IT WAS THE WRONG BODY.

682
00:42:04,990 --> 00:42:06,022
Hannah:
WHAT?

683
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,056
THE JOHN DOE,
THE ONE IN THE MASK.

684
00:42:07,058 --> 00:42:08,258
IT WAS THE WRONG ONE.

685
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,792
EMILY,
YOU'RE NOT MAKING SENSE.

686
00:42:09,794 --> 00:42:11,594
THEY JUST FOUND
A BODY TONIGHT.

687
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,996
IN A SHALLOW GRAVE
OUT IN THE WOODS.

688
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:13,997
WHERE?

689
00:42:13,999 --> 00:42:15,565
EXACTLY WHERE
SPENCER SAID IT WAS.

690
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,166
THEY FOUND
HER PURSE CLOSE BY.

<i>Mona's Voice: LOOK AT ALL</i>
<i>THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE</i>

<i>YOU TURNED ME DOWN ON OUR</i>
<i>LITTLE DRIVE UP THE MOUNTAIN.</i>

693
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:03,446
<i>BUT I BELIEVE</i>

<i>TO ASK ME AGAIN, MONA.</i>

00:43:05,383 --> 00:43:07,750
<i>I'M IN.</i>
